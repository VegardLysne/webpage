# Review sessions

## R1: A changing society and food-related behavior


### 1. Change and stability in Nordic eating practices – a sociological perspective
*Lotte Holm, University of Copenhagen, Denmark*

- In Denmark and Norway there is an increase in "fast eating"

### 3. Supporting consumers with individual level dietary change action: sweeteners as an example of a possible solution.
*Monique Raats, University of Surrey, UK*

- Paradigms of food-related policy at the individual level
    - Rational choice models
    - Predictable irrationality models
    - Social learning models

---

## R2: Modern methods for dietary analysis 

### 1. Use of loyalty-card data in assessment of food consumption in the population
*Jaakko Nevalainen, Tampere University, Finland*

- Customer loyalty cards 
    - register all purchases per card holder
    - Large participant numbers with long followup
    - Avoid recall bias, but collects data on purchases, not consumption


### 2. Improving the accuracy of dietary intake assessment: From cameras to molecules
*Gary Frost, London Imperial College, UK*

- Dietary assessment is notoriously imprecise
- Camera technology is being developed to recognize and quantify food intake

---

## R3: Vitamin D – requirements and public health policies in debate

### 1. Does vitamin D have a role in the prevention of non-skeletal diseases?
*Lars Rejnmark, Aarhus University, Denmark*

- Observational studies have consistently reported associations between low plasma 25(OH)D and non-skeletal outcomes
- Few studies have investigated the effect of increasing plasma 25(OH)D
- Vitamin D and muscle strength and function
    - Several RCT's retracted for scientific fraud (Sato et al)
    - Several studies not placebo controlled

My question: 
- In many RCT's of vitamin D supplementation, the participants are allowed to supplement outside the study treatment, resulting in considerable vitamin D intakes also in the control group, which of course may dilute any real effect. How did you take this into account when reviewing the literature? Do you think that this (potentially misleading) message of "no effect" from RCT's may convince people who could actually benefit from supplementation to refrain from it?
    - Vitamin D is very hard to study, because you can take supplements without knowing it, get it from the sun etc. 

### 2. Different vitamin D policies in the Nordic countries – effects on vitamin D intake and status

*Suvi Itkonen, University of Helsinki, Finland*


### 3. Ethnic groups and vitamin D: a common challenge in the Nordic countries?

*Ahmed Ali Madar, University of Oslo, Norway*

- Cultural habits such as wearing a veil, as well as darker skin, contribute to low vitamin D status among some ethnic groups in the Nordic countries

## R4: Quality of fat – beyond cardiovascular benefits

### 1. Brown fat – an update

### 2. Diet and liver fat

*Ulf Risérus, Uppsala, Sweden*

### 3. Glucose metabolism and low-grade inflammation

*Maria Lankinen, University of Eastern Finland, Finland*

---

## R5: Gut in the perspective

### 1. IBS – what is the best treatment?
*Magnus Simrén, University of Gothenburg, Sweden*

- Reassure the patients and give a confident diagnosis, we do not cure IBS


### 2. Gluten sensitivity
*Juha Taavela, Tampere University, Finland*



---

## R6: Prevention of type 2 diabetes: what did we learn from the DPS and PREVIEW projects? 

### 1. Dietary regulation of glucose metabolism – implication for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes

*Michael Lean, University of Glasgow, UK*

### 2. DPS

*Jaana Lindström, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland*

### 3. PREVIEW

*Anne Raben, University of Copenhagen, Denmark* 

---

## R9: New Nordic Nutrition Recommendations – towards 2022

### 1. Introduction to NNR
*Inge Tetens, University of Copenhagen, Denmark (5 min)*

### 2. The NNR 2022 project status
*Rune Blomhoff, University of Oslo, Norway (35 min)* 

### 3. Integration of sustainability into NNR
*Helle Margrete Meltzer, University of Oslo, Norway, and Ellen Trolle, DTU, Denmark (20 min)*

### 4. Discussion and feedback

# Plenary sessions

## P1: How to achieve healthy diets for all – a global perspective

*Corinna Hawkes, University of London, UK* 

- All income groups eat too little vegetables, whole-grains and legumes, and too much red meat
- To improve diet, we need to work step by step to replace foods that offer little nutrition with foods that do
- Food systems need to be reoriented toward healthier diets, in a coherent way

## P2: Genes and the prevention of type 2 diabetes, T2D-GENE trial

*Markku Laakso, University of Eastern Finland, Finland*


## P3:

# Sponsored sessions

## A scientific deep dive into the issues of meat – nutrition, health and sustainability

*Arne Astrup*
- Large effects in nutrition is implausible (ref Ioannidis)
- Hill's criteria, small effects are not relevant

My questions
- What is the rationale to claim that only large relative risk estimates (>2.0) are important? This is entirely depending on which contrast you compare. The same underlying association can easily be expressed as a small or large relative effect by changing what is considered one "unit increase" (e.g. reporting per 100g increase vs per 50g increase would double the observed relative risk).
- When talking about PURE, it is really not surprising that observed associations differ from what is observed in western populations. In western populations, higher meat intake is associated with lower socioeconomic status, while i the majority of countries included in PURE, higher meat intake is associated with higher socioeconomic status. We know that socioeconomic status is an important predictor of health outcomes. So, when considering dietary guidelines in western societies, what is the relevance of PURE?
    - **Answer:** Studies in different populations where meat is differently associated with socioeconomic status suggests that there is a considerable confounding effect of socioeconomic status that is hard to disentangle

*Francisco Zagmutt*

My questions:
- There are many key differences between nutrition and drug studies, not limited to: 1) Lack of unexposed group, 2) Continuous exposure, meaning we need to compare varying degrees of exposure rather than exposed vs non-exposed, 3) non-differential measurement error in the in the exposure, which is expected to attenuate observed associations, 
4) all food containing energy, meaning that whenever we eat something we do not eat something else, so we are really talking about substitution effects, 5) Studies are mainly done in the context of prevention among healthy, not treatment of the sick, also contributing to smaller effect sizes. Q: With these things in mind, do you really think it is rational to judge nutritional research on the same criteria as we do with drug research, as e.g. applying the GRADE criteria which is specifically developed for situations where high-quality RCTs are feasible? Is this really about lowering the bar, or is it about interpreting the evidence in a relevant context and not set unrealistic expectations?

# Oral and poster presentations

## 290: Discourses on successful weight maintenance
*Anu Joki, University of Helsinki, Finland*

- Lifelong weight maintainers focus more on lifestyle factors, while weight-loss weight maintainers focus more on control and external causes. 
    - External causes are mostly used to explain weight gain or lack of weight loss. 
    - Control is mostly used to explain successful weight loss/management. 
    - Life-long weight maintainers experience their weight management as a natural part of their lifestyle (being physically active etc)

## 125 Association between milk consumption and mortality in a Swedish cohort
*Emily Sonested, Lund University, Sweden*

- Higher intakes of nonfermented milk was associated with higher mortality risk, while inverse associations were observed with fermented milk. 
- Participants with genes indicating lactose intolerance (and subsequent lower milk intakes), had lower mortality risk.

## 168: High cholesterol levels in young adults in Norway
*Lena Leder, Mills, Norway*

- A high proportion in the young age groups have elevated plasma cholesterol
- Elevated cholesterol is asymptomatic, and is therefore not necessarily found
- There is a need for testing before the currently recommendations of testing at ages > 40 years
