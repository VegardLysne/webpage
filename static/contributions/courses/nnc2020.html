<h2>290: Discourses on successful weight maintenance</h2>
<p><em>Anu Joki, University of Helsinki, Finland</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract
Introduction: Public health strategies encourage people to maintain a stable weight, and medicalizing
obesity promotes the universal desirability of weight control. Today’s society widely reports and describes
dieting, weight concerns and body dissatisfaction as normative. As discourses guide the ways in which
people see the world and act within it, it is essential to study what kind of discourses successful weight
maintainers use when they give meaning to and explain their weight management.</p>
<p>Aim: This study explores successful weight management using qualitative methods. We aim to determine
the characteristic ways of understanding and describing weight management among those who have
succeeded in weight management and those who continue to struggle with it. Of particular interest is how
successful weight maintainers explain their success and how they talk about weight-related issues.</p>
<p>Methods: By exploring these discourses, we can access different versions of reality, which enables us to
obtain a deeper understanding of weight management. Data were collected through thematic interviews
of both lifelong (39 normal-weight individuals) and weight-loss weight maintainers (20 former PREVIEW
intervention study participants). Our analysis compared their discourses.</p>
<p>Results: Weight-loss weight maintainers’ discourses were built around various dichotomies, such as
past/present, normal/abnormal, pleasure/rationality, which they used to explain (un)successful weight
management. In contrast, lifelong weight maintainers more holistically constructed weight management as
an adopted lifestyle, and explained their success by emphasizing flexibility, a permissive mindset, and
internalized habits.</p>
<p>Discussion: By shedding light on the alternative discourse that weight maintainers use to construct weight
management positively as an achievable issue, we aim to challenge dominant weight
management discourses and inspire people to stop dieting.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lifelong weight maintainers focus more on lifestyle factors, while weight-loss weight maintainers focus more on control and external causes.
<ul>
<li>External causes are mostly used to explain weight gain or lack of weight loss.</li>
<li>Control is mostly used to explain successful weight loss/management.</li>
<li>Life-long weight maintainers experience their weight management as a natural part of their lifestyle (being physically active etc)</li>
