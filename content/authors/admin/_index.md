I'm a clinical dietitian, currently finishing my PhD at the [University of Bergen](www.uib.no). In my project I have used animal and human data to explore the regulation of one-carbon metabolism and B-vitamin status, with a focus on the activation of PPAR alpha and dietary macronutrient composition. My main academic interests are the methodology and statistical methods used in nutritional epidemiology. My main research tool is R and RStudio, where I do all my statistical analyses and writing. See my full CV [here](/files/cv.pdf)

Beside work I'm a big sports fan. My main sport is volleyball, where I've been active since the age of 15. I'm currently coaching the mens recruit team at [TIF Viking](www.tifviking.no), as well as scouting and performing statistical analyses for the mens first team. My musical preference is hard rock and related genres.
