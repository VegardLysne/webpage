I'm a clinical dietitian from Norway, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at [Haukeland University Hospital](https://helse-bergen.no/). I currently hold positions as editorial board member at [The Norwegian Journal of Nutrition](www.ntfe.no), member of the Scientific Panel on Nutrition, Dietetic Products, Novel Food and Allergy at the [Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment (VKM)](www.vkm.no), and Review Editor at [Frontiers in Nutrition](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition).

In my PhD project at [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no), I used animal and human data to explore the effects of PPAR&alpha;-activation and dietary macronutrient composition on one-carbon metabolism and B-vitamin status. My main research interests are the methodology and statistical methods used in nutritional epidemiology, and my main research tools are [R and RStudio](www.rstudio.com). 

Beside work I'm a big sports fan. My main sport is volleyball, where I'm currently the assistant coach of the mens recruit team and perform scouting and statistical analyses for the mens first team at [TIF Viking](http://www.tifviking.no/volleyball/), using [Data Volley 4](https://www.dataproject.com/Products/EU/en/Volleyball/DataVolley4). I'm also a proud supporter of my local football team Brann, as well as Manchester United. My musical preference is heavy metal, hard rock, and related genres.
