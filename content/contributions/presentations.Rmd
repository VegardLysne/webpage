This is a list of my presentations at conferences and meetings. 

# 2020

## Mohn Nutrition Research Laboratory seminar, Solstrand, Bergen, Norway

This was the first seminar organized by the Mohn Nutrition Research Laboratory. I presented a workshop on the topics of P-values and statistical significance. The main goal was to reflect on our current approach, and discuss how we may improve.
