I'm currently in Dublin, attending the European Nutrition Conference ([FENS](http://www.fens2019.org/)), and will try to provide some updates during the week. The conference starts tomorrow, Tuesday October 15, and last until friday. 

You can find my conference notes [here](/contributions/courses/fens2019.html), and you can also find updates by following the [#FENS2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FENS2019) on Twitter!

# Tuesday - Day 1
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/opening.jpg)
It's 09:45 and dhe conference is about to start, with the opening ceremony followed by the first plenary session. 1700 participants from all over the world are getting ready for a week of nutrition research, discussions and networking!

## Malnutrition in an obese world
The first plenary lecture was presented by **Joäo Breda**, from the World Health Organization, on the topic of *Drivers across the lifecycle of malnutrition in an obese world - European perspectives*. His talk focused on the importance of nutrition in reaching many of the sustainable development goals. Using data from European countries, he illustrated nutritional challenges such as the increasing prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity. The first pillar in the  European Food and Nutrition Action plan 2015-2020 is to create a healthy food and drink environment. This include strategies to reduce the intake of sugar and salt. The second pillar is nutrition during life cycle, where Breda was not happy with the low compliance to exclusive breast feeding in the European countries. The rest of the talk focused on the final three pillars, including the large potential for improving the communication of nutritional information to the public, as well as the need for improving nutritional surveilance and research regarding the implementation of selected interventions.

## Genetics, salt, riboflavin and hypertension
The next session I attended had 3 speakers. First, **Catherine Graham** told us about *The associations between genetics, salt taste perception and salt intake in young adults*. Salt intake continues to be the #1 dietary risk factor for non-communicable diseases, but reducing salt intake is difficult. A preference to salty taste, as well as genetic factor lowering the salt taste sensitivity, may be contributors to the persistent high salt intake in populations. 

Next up, **Martina Rooney** told us about *Central blood pressure in adults screened for a genetic polymorphism in folate metabolism*. Genes are commonly regarded as non-modifiable risk factors, but in the presence of high-penetrance gene-nutrient interactions, this paradigm does not necessarily hold. A genetic variant in the MTHFR gene (C677T), affecting ~10% of the population, has been consistently linked to hypertension risk, and this variant is responsive to low-dose riboflavin supplementation. Previous research have focused on preipheral blood pressure. In her research, Rooney have shown that these individuals also have higher central blood pressure. 

Finally, **Emma O'Sullivan** continued the MTHFR TT-story, by investigating riboflavin status in a population screened for this genotype. They found no large differences in riboflavin status or intake across the MTHFR genotypes, but a large proportion (14% of men, 22% of women) of the population have intakes below the EAR. How riboflavin status affects the blood pressure in the population should be further addressed.

## Metabolic obesity
After lunch I attended the session on metabolic obesity. Overweight and obesity is commonly classified by BMI, but this doesn't tell us much regarding metabolic health.

The first talk was by **Norbert Stefan**, on *Definition and clinical Impact of metabolically healthy and unhealthy Obesity*. Although obesity is a key risk factor for life style diseases, the risk is only moderately elevated in those with a metabolically healthy phenotype. At the same time, normal weight people with a metabolically unhealthy phenotype also have increased mortality. A strong correlation have been reported between liver fat and insulin resistance, which is stronger than the association with visceral fat mass. The concept of metabolically healthy obesity was presented, and defined by being obese but having < 2 metabolic risk parameters, and data was presented suggesting that about 25% of obese persons were metabolically healthy. Further, compared to metabolically healthy normal-weight, being metabolically healthy obese was associated with only 28% increased risk, while the metabolically unhealthy normal-weight had 115% increased risk. In conclusion, he recommend to stratify the risk assessment according to metabolic health to accomplish the goal of providing personalized treatment to patients.

**Louise Thomas** then told us about current advances in our methods of predicting visceral fat mass. Common methods are MRI scans and DEXA. Thomas showed that these methods are actually measuring different things, but as they are highly correlated, this suggests that this is a scaling issue. A proxy measure is based on waist circumference, which works well on the group level, but is less good on the individual level. MRI continues to be the gold standard, but simpler methods such as predictive algorithms shows promise, especially combined with machine learning.

To close the session, **Hannele Yki-Järvinen** presented on the *Effects of overfeeding different diets on the human liver*, with a focus on the accumulation of liver fat. She showed data that metabolically determined non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is dominated by saturated triglycerides and ceramides, and increases the risk of insulin resistance. On the other hand, genetically determined NAFLD is dominated by polyunsaturated triglycerides, and does not increase insulin resistance risk. When considering the effect on dietary composition on liver fat, several smaller studies have shown that low-carb/high-fat diets increases liver fat more than the high-carb/low-fat diets. 
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Yki-Jarvinen.jpg)

Further, saturated fat increases liver fat more than polyunsaturated fat. 
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Yki-Jarvinen2.jpg)
Metabolically determined NAFLD can be a consequence of overeating simple sugars, due to increased de novo lipogenesis. However, in the context of similar weight gain, saturated fat induces greater metabolic harm compared to simple sugars. 

## Nutrition communication

In the next workshop, the topic of communication of nutrition information was on the agenda. This is a big challenge as nutrition information is now available from numerous sources including the media, internet, health professionals, social influencers and peers. 

The first talk of the workshow was given by **Robert O'Connor**, asking the question *What’s driving the nutritional problem in cancer?*. In his talk, he focused on the multitude of dietary recommendations aimed at cancer patients, and their challenge in discerning between evidence-based and pseudoscientific information. A problem he referred to as "scientification" of nutrition advertisement. One increasingly popular phrase in food advertisement is "let food be thy medicine", on which O'Connors comment was "food is not medicine for healthy people, it simply isn't". He discussed the problems of health "shockumentaries" spreading misinformation, and further pointed out that although science is increasingly available, scientific understanding is not. The finishing point was that the impact of this confusing terrain of misinformation is an increase in preventable cancer mortalities due to people following unfounded advice, including postponing or not receiving actually evidence-based treatments. 

In the next talk, **Eileen O'Sullivan**, cancer patient and patient advocate, talked about *what advice the public believes*. As a patient, she did not receive any specific dietary advice from the hospital, but met many "snakeoil salesmen", trying to take advantage of her vulnerability as a patient. She raised the point that not only patients themselves, but also relatives, are targeted by people offering non-evidence based advice. And this advice doesn't only come from amateurs, there are many examples of doctors and nutritionists giving harmful advice. Phrases such as "This food feeds your cancer", "Big pharma wants you to be sick", and victim blaming such as "you are sick because you ate this and that", are not uncommonly encountered for a cancer patient. Ketogenic diets, alkaline diets, raw food, functional food, paleo diet, fasting and organic are only some examples of pseudoscientific dietary fads targeting cancer patients. There is an increased need for nutritional professionals to counter this misinformation and provide evidence-based advice. 

Journalist and radio-presenter **Philip Boucher-Hayes** then provided his thought on *Journalism and the proliferation of nutribabble*. He started by pointing out that noone sells books or TV programs with boring advice such as eating a little bit less or moving a little bit more. And when writing his book, he discovered that there really were no fact checks, and that correctness was prioritized below novelty. The same goes for TV-shows, which he describes as less fact checked than the commercials between the shows. He finished his talk by encouraging researchers to occupy the same space as the charlatans does, and to do this by talking in a language people can relate to, not "like an academic", as well as keeping the message brief and to the point.

To finish the workshop, **Gabriel Scally** gave a talk on *Full disclosure - on food and nutrition*. He started by disagreeing with the notion that science is highly accessible, referring to the problems of paywalls limiting the access to the majority of scientific publications. And without confirming or denying it's helpfullness of resources such as Sci-hub, let's just say it was mentioned. He then continued by talking about content of food that is not disclosed, such as pesticide and antibiotic residue. He did emphasize that the doses are small, but his position was that it should be disclosed. 

## Low-carbohydrate diets and diabetes
The final talk I attended on the tuesday was by **Chaitong Churuangsuk**, who performed a systematic review of reviews of the effectiveness of low-carbohydrate diets. Overall, his analyses of 10 systematic reviews suggested that the difference in weight loss compared to low-fat diets were small (< 1 kg). However, he observed that reviews of lower quality, as well as the reviews reporting larger effects, were more frequently cited. He further observed that potential risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as iodine, was being neglected in the literature. Churuangsuk concluded that low-carbohydrate diets could be effective for weight loss, and also may lower HbA1c and the need for diabetes medications, especially when weight loss was achieved. However, long-term safety, and potential negative effects including increased LDL-cholesterol should be considered. The latter can be mitigated by designing a low-carbohydrate diet with plant based protein and fat sources, limited in saturated fat.  

# Wednesday - Day 2
Day 2 of the conference is about to start, with a keynote lecture from **Arne Astrup**. Later today my plan is to attend some sessions on personalized nutrition, and at the end there will be a debate on whether the individual or the society have the primary responsibility to prevent obesity.

## Weight management according to glucose metabolism
Arne Astrup presented the first keynote on *Personalized dietary obesity weight management determined by glucose metabolism and microbiota*. In his talk, he showed data from weight loss trials, demonstrating highly variable results. Based on research suggesting that carbohydrates may have a great satiating effect in insulin sensitive individuals, but maybe less so in those with insulin resistance, he provided the hypothesis that those with prediabetes and diabetes would benefit from a lower carbohydrate diet. By reanalyzing data from large international diet studies, such as [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28679551), they have shown that insulin resistant individuals with diabetes or prediabetes responds better to lower-carbohydrate and high fiber diets, when considering weight loss and maintenance. In the second part of his talk, he showed data suggesting that gut microbiota also contributes to the individual response to dietary exposures. In particular, the effect of fiber seems dependent on the microbiota composition. In conclusion, Astrup holds the position that we should start providing individualized recommendations for weight management based on glycemic status, while the data on microbiota, albeit promising, needs more work. During the question session, he emphasized that he recommended a moderate carbohydrate restriction, and that he was not a big fan of very restrictive diets.

## Nutrigenomics, are we there yet?
In the next session I attended, the topic was nutrigenomics. In the first talk, **Sander Kersten** started by telling us about gene-nutrient interactions, that work both ways. Nutrigenomics refer to how the food influences our gene expression, while nutrigenetics refer to how our genes influence our response to diet. For polygenic diseases, we all carry on average 160 risk alleles. By following a healthy diet, achieved by general or personalized recommendations, you can delay or prevent disease development relative to your polygenic burden. 
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Kersten.jpg)
However, risk cannot be monitored on the individual level, but biomarkers can. In the future, with improved technology including wearables etc, nutrigenomics can contribute to identify individuals for early dietary interventions. Kersten closed his lecture by pointing out that there's still a large knowledge gap, especially in providing mechanistic explanations for well established effects such as the triglyceride lowering by omega-3 fatty acids, or the cholesterol raising effects of trans fatty acids of cafestol. Nutrigenomics can contribute to fill this gap.

**Stephen O'Rahilly** was supposed to give a talk on *The causes and consequences of obesity*, but decided to go off script and focus on growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). GDF15 is a hormone signalling to the brain in situations of stress, and facilitate aversion towards that stimuli. Providing GDF15 to animals have been used to induce aversion towards certain foods. Circulating amounts of GDF15 is not postprandially regulated, but chronic nutrition stress such as overfeeding increases the concentrations. Also, animals lacking GDF15 are more likely to become obese, and weight loss obtained by metformin treatment is highly correlated to the degree of increase in circulating GDF15. Collectively, this suggests a role in body weight regulation. Further, a role of GDF15 in cancer cachexia and in hyperemesis gravidarum was discussed, providing a potential future target for treatment. 

The last talk of the session was given by **Hannelore Daniel**, on the topic of *Nutritional phenotyping*, which she defined as "assessing and quantifying the acute and chronic resonses of the organism to the individual food items or diet". During the day, we constantly switch between anabolic and catabolic state, and a relevant question is whether the anabolic/catabolic space is different between people. She presented data from the HuMet and nutriTECH studies, where participants were exposed to different interventions and extensively phenotyped. They were able to identify different metabotypes who presented different responses to metabolic challenges such as weight loss. This suggests that phenotyping may be helpful to predict effects of nutritional interventions. 

## Personalized nutrition for health
After lunch I attended the symposia on personalized nutrition for health, with the outspoken goal of seeking to "address the hype versus hope, fact versus fallacy, that is anticipated from Personalised Nutrition research and to understand whether the Personalised Nutrition paradigm is relevant to all health/age contexts".

The first speaker was **Frank Hu**, who talked about *Precision nutrition for the prevention and management of cardiometabolic diseases: Hype or hope?*. He started by saying that modern nutrition research needs to integrate different approaches to make progress. 
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Hu.jpg)
According to Hu, the goals of precision nutrition are wider than just providing recommendations to the individual. It also includes improving out ability to measure diet accurately. In a recent study they compared different dietary instruments, and concluded that a 2 week food record was the most accurate method. However, when compared to biomarkers, a food frequency questionnaire performed as well as a 7-day food record. Hu continued the talk by showing data from PREDIMED, where they developed a metabolic signature capturing the adherence to the mediterranean diet. This signature was more strongly related to CVD risk than self-reported adherence, suggesting a role for metabolic signatures as measures of dietary adherence. 

Of course Hu also touched upon the recen publication on red meat intake, concluding that the evidence, albeit extremely consistent, was weak and that we should just continue our current intake. Hu pointed out that the criteria used by the authors are not suited to assess the level of evidence in epidemiological research, and that applying the same criteria to any lifestyle-disease association would come to the same conclusion, also for well established risk factors as physical inactivity, secondhand smoking etc.

Hu mentioned a few examples of commercially available test kits such as *Day Two* and *23andme*, who offer personalized nutritional advice based on your microbiome or genetics. However, he pointed out that the science behind these advice is simply not there, questioning their usefulness. Hu finished his talk by emphasizing that obesity is not driven by changes in our genes, but by changes in our food environment. Therefore personalized nutrition must be integrated with public health nutrition as well as planetary nutrition, to promote personal, personal and planetary health.

The next speaker was **Hannelore Daniel**, with her talk titled *Personalised nutrition for the metagenome: host versus microbiome*. She pointed out that although diet influences the microbiome, geographical location was by far the most important factor. And therefore, diet-microbiome effects are hard to replicate in different contexts. 
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Daniel.jpg)
For many years we have believed that we are vastly outnumbered by our bacteria, but Daniel points out that this number traces back to a single publication from 1972, which has never been questioned. More recent analyses conclude that the bacteria content in our intestines comprises ~95g, and cell count to be approximately [1:1 with human cells](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002533). The main take-home point from this talk was that we should not forget gastrointestinal physiology when attributing health effects to the microbiome. Altering intestinal transit time have a profound effect on microbial amount and diversity, and has also been shown to influence health related parameters.

The last talk of the session was given by **Lorraine Brennan**, on the *otential of Precision Nutrition to improve Health*. When talking about precision nutrition, Brennan refer to the concept of giving specific advice to the individual, which is different from what we do today where we give different advice to specific subgroups. In a study where participants received either standard advice, or personalized advice based on blood and gene tests, higher adherence was observed in the latter group, demonstrating the potential for this approach. In the next part of the talk was considering using biomarkers as a complement to self-reported dietary intake data. Brennan used *proline betaine* as an example of a biomarker of citrus intake. Recently, they published a [paper](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/110/4/977/5552381) on combining biomarker data with self-reported data to correct for misreporting, which is a promising approach to improve dietary intake data. Brennan finished her talk by telling us about her approach for developing targeted recommendations to segments of the population, through metabotyping and decision threes.  

## Low-calorie sweeteners
After the session on precision nutrition, I moved on to a session on the use of low-calorie sweeteners. First up, **Margaret Ashwell** presented the Report from a 2018 Expert Consensus Workshop on recommendations about the use of low calorie sweeteners. Different view prevail, where although everyone agrees that sugar intake should be reduced, people disagree whether low-calorie sweeteners are a good alternative. The report considered three main topics, namely weight management and glucose control, safety and consumer perception and the role of sweeteners in relation to policy. They report on what is known, what is not known and what should be done. The panel agreed that low-calorie sweeteners are safe, and can help reducing sugar intake. They conclude that the sweeteners have the same effect on appetite as water. Further, the negative effects reported in relation to cardiometabolic health is most likely due to confounding by adiposity. However, less is known about long-term effects, what is driving the different consumer perception, and how low-calorie sweeteners influence diet quality in the longer term. 

**Anne Raben** continued the session by presenting results from trials and metaanalyses of low-calorie sweeteners on parameters of body weight and glycemic control. Overall, compared to sucrose, the low-calorie sweeteners was associated with reduced body weight. In one study, low-calorie sweetener was even superior to water, which potentially can be explained by the fact that having a sweet option may increase adherence to the diet as compared to just having water. Several studies have also considered the effect on glycemic control, and consistently conclude that the sweeteners are beneficial when compared with sucrose.

The last talk of the session was given by **Jason Halford**, presenting his research on the consumer's views. He showed results indicating that most low-calorie sweetener consumers report that they enjoy them, and also use them as a tool for body weight control. Interestingly, in a [recent paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30902635) they found that low-calorie beverage consumers actively seeked these beverages in situations of craving, and did not overconsume calories. Sugar-sweeteened beverage consumers, on the other hand, were more likely to overconsume when exposed to cravings. This indicates that low-energy sweeteners can be a tool to handle cravings to avoid overeating. 

## Biomarkers of riboflavin status
After the session on sweeteners, I made it to the last talk in the session focusing on the DERiVE project, by **Yvonne Lamers**. She presented data demonstrating that plasma concentrations of the riboflavin markers FAD and FMN are not good markers to predict vitamin B2 status. However, combining FMN, FAD and riboflavin into *total plasma riboflavin* showed promise as a vitamin B2 status marker, when compared to the gold standard functional marker EGRac (Eryhrocyte Glutathione Reductase activity coefficient). 
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Lamers.jpg)

## Credibility vs clickbait
The next step after doing research in nutrition is to communicate the findings to the public. In a session organized by Eat Well Global, this was the topic. Today social media plays a central role in the dissemination of nutrition information, and not always in a good way. Influencers are spreading misinformation at the speed of light, and a big challenge is to 

The first speaker was [**Taylor Wallace**](https://drtaylorwallace.com/), with his thoughts on scientific communication. He emphasized the importance of identifying the importance of identifying stakeholders who have the power to implement your message. Preaching to the choir is not an effective way of getting your message across, but is most often what happens in nutrition communication. Further, Wallace emphasized the importance of framing your findings to get your main messages across, and encouraged the use of digital, social and traditional media to disseminate your findings. Non-traditional sources can also be an effective arena for communication, as you could reach audiences you normally wouldn't reach. Wallace himself appears on the Dr.Oz show, and have published articles on his blog. 

The second speaker was **Jovanka Vis**, who talked about how to use social media to spread science. She started her talk by talking about the echo chamber known as the internet, where everyone has an opinion. She focused on how to frame your message in a positive way, e.g. "eat less meat" vs "there is more than meat", where the same message is delivered in different packages by changing the focus. Vis showed several example of how the Netherlands Nutrition Centre have communicated their dietary advice to the consumers, using videos, games and being visible in social media. At the end of her talk, Vis encouraged the audience to engage in the debate, and always respond when approached in social media. Never waste a good crisis!

## Thursday - Day 3
This day started at the poster session, where several of my colleagues, **Anthea Van Parys**, **Cathrine Horn**, **Marte Trollebø** and **Helene Dahl**, presented their work. 
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Anthea poster.jpg)![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Cathrine poster.jpg)![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Helene poster.jpg)![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Marte poster.jpg)

## Malnutrition in Obesity
The first plenary session of the day was presented by **Ellen Blaak** with her talk *Current metabolic perspectives on malnutrition in obesity*. She started by defining malnutrition, which is not just restricted to deficiency, but any abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intakes. Increasing evidence is suggesting insulin resistance as a parameter to identify subgroups for precision nutrition, but Blaak asked the question if tissue-specific insulin resistance may elicit different metabolic consequences, depending on which tissue is affected. 
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Blaak.jpg)
Blaak showed us data investigating metabolomic profiles associated with insulin resistance in the liver and muscle, respectively. Although there were some overlap, there were also some tissue-specific differences. Further, a gender specific effect on plasma lipid profile were observed, where insulin resistance in the liver causes a particular worsening of lipid profile in women. She ended her talk by emphasizing that targeted approaches are needed to optimize nutrition for cardiometabolic health.

## Ultra-processed food
The next session I attended was on the topic of ultra-processed food. This is a concept I'm personally struggling with. I get the overall point that highly processed food on average is often not the most healthy options. My main problem is that I cannot find a simple definition of what ultra-processed foods are, and as there are also many good aspects of food processing I'm not sure if this is a good way of categorizing what is healthy and what is not, and I'm not convinced that such a system is needed to identify healthy foods in general. However, this may perfectly reflect my own ignorance, and I hope this session will convince me that I'm wrong!

The first talk was by **Jean-Claude Moubarac**, trying to provide an overview of what ultraprocessed foods are and how they influence overall dietary processing. He started by giving an overview of the evolution of food processing, and pointed out that we're no longer working with ingredients, but with molecules.
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Moubarac.jpg)
He further introduced the NOVA classification. The first group includes unprocessed or minimally processed food. The second group includes processed culinary ingredients such as sugar and oils. Group 3 include processed foods, such as cured meat. The last group is the ultraprocessed foods, which is industrial foods and drink formulations made mostly from refined artificial substances and additives. Consumption data demonstrate that the intake of foods from the NOVA group 4 is increasing at a rapid pace, and there are concerns regarding how this influence the overall quality of the diet. 

Data from the NOVA multi-country study shows that those with the highest intake of ultraprocessed foods eat more energy, more added sugar, more salt, less fiber, less protein and less micronutrients. In general, higher consumption of nutrients we want to limit, and lower consumptions of favorable nutrients. A healthy diet is low in ultra-processed foods. 

The symposia was continued with a talk from **Mathilde Touvier**, presenting epidemiological perspectives on *ultra-processed foods and health*. She started by underlining the good sides of food processing, in terms of reducing microbiological risk, increasing bioavailability and increasing shelf-life. She introduced the NUTRI-SCORE, a scale from A-E classifying the nutritional quality of foods. In the E category, 85% of the foods are ultra-processed. However, 24% of the foods in the A category is also ultra-processed, and 60-70% of the B-D categories. This suggests that not all ultra-processed foods are alike when considering nutritional quality.
![](/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/Touvier.jpg)
In the NutriNet-Santé cohort, ultra-processed foods comprises 18 % of the food intake, but contributes with 35% of the energy intake. Further, higher intake of ultra-processed foods are associated with increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mortality. When performing similar analyses for unprocessed food intakes, they observed lower risk. 

The final talk of the session was given by **Marit Kolby Zinöcker**, with her presentation on *potential Mechanisms connecting Ultra-processed Foods with Gut Inflammation*. She started by stating the obvious: unhealthy diets are drivers of metabolic disease. The question is how, and Zinöckers hypothesis is that changes introduced during food processing causes low-grade inflammation by interacting with the microbiome. She introduced the concept of acellular foods/nutrients. Normally, nutrients are contained within the cell structures, but during processing these structures are broken down. This makes the nutrients more available in the small intestine, increasing the potential for bacterial growth. Further, less nutrients is transferred to the microbiota in the colon. Altogether, this may cause low-grade inflammation. Zinôcker concluded her talk by saying that when the jury on these foods are out, we should probably emphasize eating more freshly made foods and less highly processed foods. I think we all agree with that conclusion regardless of our view on the concept of ultra-processed foods.
