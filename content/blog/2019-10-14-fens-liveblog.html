I’m currently in Dublin, attending the European Nutrition Conference (<a href="http://www.fens2019.org/">FENS</a>), and will try to provide some updates during the week. The conference starts tomorrow, Tuesday October 15, and last until friday.</p>
<p>You can find my conference notes <a href="/contributions/courses/fens2019.html">here</a>, and you can also find updates by following the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FENS2019">#FENS2019</a> on Twitter!</p>

The conference is about to start, with the opening ceremony followed by the first plenary session. 1700 participants from all over the world are getting ready for a week of nutrition research!</p>

<p>The first plenary lecture was presented by <strong>Joäo Breda</strong>, from the World Health Organization, on the topic of <em>Drivers across the lifecycle of malnutrition in an obese world - European perspectives</em>. His talk focused on the importance of nutrition in reaching many of the sustainable development goals. Using data from European countries, he illustrated nutritional challenges such as the increasing prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity. The first pillar in the European Food and Nutrition Action plan 2015-2020 is to create a healthy food and drink environment. This include strategies to reduce the intake of sugar and salt. The second pillar is nutrition during life cycle, where Breda was not happy with the low compliance to exclusive breast feeding in the European countries. The rest of the talk focused on the final three pillars, including the large potential for improving the communication of nutritional information to the public, as well as the need for improving nutritional surveilance and research regarding the implementation of selected interventions.</p>

<p>The next session I attended had 3 speakers. First, <strong>Catherine Graham</strong> told us about <em>The associations between genetics, salt taste perception and salt intake in young adults</em>. Salt intake continues to be the #1 dietary risk factor for non-communicable diseases, but reducing salt intake is difficult. A preference to salty taste, as well as genetic factor lowering the salt taste sensitivity, may be contributors to the persistent high salt intake in populations.</p>
<p>Next up, <strong>Martina Rooney</strong> told us about <em>Central blood pressure in adults screened for a genetic polymorphism in folate metabolism</em>. Genes are commonly regarded as non-modifiable risk factors, but in the presence of high-penetrance gene-nutrient interactions, this paradigm does not necessarily hold. A genetic variant in the MTHFR gene (C677T), affecting ~10% of the population, has been consistently linked to hypertension risk, and this variant is responsive to low-dose riboflavin supplementation. Previous research have focused on preipheral blood pressure. In her research, Rooney have shown that these individuals also have higher central blood pressure.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Emma O’Sullivan</strong> continued the MTHFR TT-story, by investigating riboflavin status in a population screened for this genotype. They found no large differences in riboflavin status or intake across the MTHFR genotypes, but a large proportion (14% of men, 22% of women) of the population have intakes below the EAR. How riboflavin status affects the blood pressure in the population should be further addressed.</p>
