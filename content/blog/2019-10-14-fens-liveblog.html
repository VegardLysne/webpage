<h1>Tuesday - Day 1</h1>
<p><img src="/blog/2019-10-14-fens-liveblog_files/opening.jpg" />
It’s 09:45 and dhe conference is about to start, with the opening ceremony followed by the first plenary session. 1700 participants from all over the world are getting ready for a week of nutrition research, discussions and networking!</p>
<div id="malnutrition-in-an-obese-world" class="section level2">
<h2>Malnutrition in an obese world</h2>
<p>The first plenary lecture was presented by <strong>Joäo Breda</strong>, from the World Health Organization, on the topic of <em>Drivers across the lifecycle of malnutrition in an obese world - European perspectives</em>. His talk focused on the importance of nutrition in reaching many of the sustainable development goals. Using data from European countries, he illustrated nutritional challenges such as the increasing prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity. The first pillar in the European Food and Nutrition Action plan 2015-2020 is to create a healthy food and drink environment. This include strategies to reduce the intake of sugar and salt. The second pillar is nutrition during life cycle, where Breda was not happy with the low compliance to exclusive breast feeding in the European countries. The rest of the talk focused on the final three pillars, including the large potential for improving the communication of nutritional information to the public, as well as the need for improving nutritional surveilance and research regarding the implementation of selected interventions.</p>

<h2>Genetics, salt, riboflavin and hypertension</h2>
<p>The next session I attended had 3 speakers. First, <strong>Catherine Graham</strong> told us about <em>The associations between genetics, salt taste perception and salt intake in young adults</em>. Salt intake continues to be the #1 dietary risk factor for non-communicable diseases, but reducing salt intake is difficult. A preference to salty taste, as well as genetic factor lowering the salt taste sensitivity, may be contributors to the persistent high salt intake in populations.</p>
<p>Next up, <strong>Martina Rooney</strong> told us about <em>Central blood pressure in adults screened for a genetic polymorphism in folate metabolism</em>. Genes are commonly regarded as non-modifiable risk factors, but in the presence of high-penetrance gene-nutrient interactions, this paradigm does not necessarily hold. A genetic variant in the MTHFR gene (C677T), affecting ~10% of the population, has been consistently linked to hypertension risk, and this variant is responsive to low-dose riboflavin supplementation. Previous research have focused on preipheral blood pressure. In her research, Rooney have shown that these individuals also have higher central blood pressure.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Emma O’Sullivan</strong> continued the MTHFR TT-story, by investigating riboflavin status in a population screened for this genotype. They found no large differences in riboflavin status or intake across the MTHFR genotypes, but a large proportion (14% of men, 22% of women) of the population have intakes below the EAR. How riboflavin status affects the blood pressure in the population should be further addressed.</p>

<div id="metabolic-obesity" class="section level2">
<h2>Metabolic obesity</h2>
<p>After lunch I attended the session on metabolic obesity. Overweight and obesity is commonly classified by BMI, but this doesn’t tell us much regarding metabolic health.</p>
<p>The first talk was by <strong>Norbert Stefan</strong>, on <em>Definition and clinical Impact of metabolically healthy and unhealthy Obesity</em>. Although obesity is a key risk factor for life style diseases, the risk is only moderately elevated in those with a metabolically healthy phenotype. At the same time, normal weight people with a metabolically unhealthy phenotype also have increased mortality. A strong correlation have been reported between liver fat and insulin resistance, which is stronger than the association with visceral fat mass. The concept of metabolically healthy obesity was presented, and defined by being obese but having &lt; 2 metabolic risk parameters, and data was presented suggesting that about 25% of obese persons were metabolically healthy. Further, compared to metabolically healthy normal-weight, being metabolically healthy obese was associated with only 28% increased risk, while the metabolically unhealthy normal-weight had 115% increased risk. In conclusion, he recommend to stratify the risk assessment according to metabolic health to accomplish the goal of providing personalized treatment to patients.

<p><strong>Louise Thomas</strong> then told us about current advances in our methods of predicting visceral fat mass. Common methods are MRI scans and DEXA. Thomas showed that these methods are actually measuring different things, but as they are highly correlated, this suggests that this is a scaling issue. A proxy measure is based on waist circumference, which works well on the group level, but is less good on the individual level. MRI continues to be the gold standard, but simpler methods such as predictive algorithms shows promise, especially combined with machine learning.</p>
<p>To close the session, <strong>Hannele Yki-Järvinen</strong> presented on the <em>Effects of overfeeding different diets on the human liver</em>, with a focus on the accumulation of liver fat. She showed data that metabolically determined non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is dominated by saturated triglycerides and ceramides, and increases the risk of insulin resistance. On the other hand, genetically determined NAFLD is dominated by polyunsaturated triglycerides, and does not increase insulin resistance risk. When considering the effect on dietary composition on liver fat, several smaller studies have shown that low-carb/high-fat diets increases liver fat more than the high-carb/low-fat diets.

<p>Further, saturated fat increases liver fat more than polyunsaturated fat.

Metabolically determined NAFLD can be a consequence of overeating simple sugars, due to increased de novo lipogenesis. However, in the context of similar weight gain, saturated fat induces greater metabolic harm compared to simple sugars.</p>

<div id="nutrition-communication" class="section level2">
<h2>Nutrition communication</h2>
<p>In the next workshop, the topic of communication of nutrition information was on the agenda. This is a big challenge as nutrition information is now available from numerous sources including the media, internet, health professionals, social influencers and peers.</p>
<p>The first talk of the workshow was given by <strong>Robert O’Connor</strong>, asking the question <em>What’s driving the nutritional problem in cancer?</em>. In his talk, he focused on the multitude of dietary recommendations aimed at cancer patients, and their challenge in discerning between evidence-based and pseudoscientific information. A problem he referred to as “scientification” of nutrition advertisement. One increasingly popular phrase in food advertisement is “let food be thy medicine”, on which O’Connors comment was “food is not medicine for healthy people, it simply isn’t”. He discussed the problems of health “shockumentaries” spreading misinformation, and further pointed out that although science is increasingly available, scientific understanding is not. The finishing point was that the impact of this confusing terrain of misinformation is an increase in preventable cancer mortalities due to people following unfounded advice, including postponing or not receiving actually evidence-based treatments.</p>
<p>In the next talk, <strong>Eileen O’Sullivan</strong>, cancer patient and patient advocate, talked about <em>what advice the public believes</em>. As a patient, she did not receive any specific dietary advice from the hospital, but met many “snakeoil salesmen”, trying to take advantage of her vulnerability as a patient. She raised the point that not only patients themselves, but also relatives, are targeted by people offering non-evidence based advice. And this advice doesn’t only come from amateurs, there are many examples of doctors and nutritionists giving harmful advice. Phrases such as “This food feeds your cancer”, “Big pharma wants you to be sick”, and victim blaming such as “you are sick because you ate this and that”, are not uncommonly encountered for a cancer patient. Ketogenic diets, alkaline diets, raw food, functional food, paleo diet, fasting and organic are only some examples of pseudoscientific dietary fads targeting cancer patients. There is an increased need for nutritional professionals to counter this misinformation and provide evidence-based advice.</p>
<p>Journalist and radio-presenter <strong>Philip Boucher-Hayes</strong> then provided his thought on <em>Journalism and the proliferation of nutribabble</em>. He started by pointing out that noone sells books or TV programs with boring advice such as eating a little bit less or moving a little bit more. And when writing his book, he discovered that there really were no fact checks, and that correctness was prioritized below novelty. The same goes for TV-shows, which he describes as less fact checked than the commercials between the shows. He finished his talk by encouraging researchers to occupy the same space as the charlatans does, and to do this by talking in a language people can relate to, not “like an academic”, as well as keeping the message brief and to the point.</p>
<p>To finish the workshop, <strong>Gabriel Scally</strong> gave a talk on <em>Full disclosure - on food and nutrition</em>. He started by disagreeing with the notion that science is highly accessible, referring to the problems of paywalls limiting the access to the majority of scientific publications. And without confirming or denying it’s helpfullness of resources such as Sci-hub, let’s just say it was mentioned. He then continued by talking about content of food that is not disclosed, such as pesticide and antibiotic residue. He did emphasize that the doses are small, but his position was that it should be disclosed.</p>

<div id="low-carbohydrate-diets-and-diabetes" class="section level1">
<h1>Low-carbohydrate diets and diabetes</h1>
<p>The final talk I attended on the tuesday was by <strong>Chaitong Churuangsuk</strong>, who performed a systematic review of reviews of the effectiveness of low-carbohydrate diets. Overall, his analyses of 10 systematic reviews suggested that the difference in weight loss compared to low-fat diets were small (&lt; 1 kg). However, he observed that reviews of lower quality, as well as the reviews reporting larger effects, were more frequently cited. He further observed that potential risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as iodine, was being neglected in the literature. Churuangsuk concluded that low-carbohydrate diets could be effective for weight loss, and also may lower HbA1c and the need for diabetes medications, especially when weight loss was achieved. However, long-term safety, and potential negative effects including increased LDL-cholesterol should be considered. The latter can be mitigated by designing a low-carbohydrate diet with plant based protein and fat sources, limited in saturated fat.</p>
