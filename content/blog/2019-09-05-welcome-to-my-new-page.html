<p>It was time for me to make a personal homepage, and a few hours exploring <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> and the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/">Hugo Academic theme</a> later, here we are! At the time of writing this post, the page is still under construction, and more things will be added as we go. But it’s a start!</p>
<p>A few years ago, during my studies, I started the webpage <a href="www.friskogfunksjonell.no">Frisk og Funksjonell</a>, where I together with some fellow students and colleagues published blog articles (in Norwegian) on different topics related to nutrition, health and science. That page will of course remain, as it’s a useful resource when these topics needs refreshing. Some of my articles will probably also appear in english here at some point.</p>
<div id="purpose" class="section level2">
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This page will be different. The main purpose of this page is to be a place to maintain an updated overview of my academic work, including <a href="/contributions/publications">my publications</a>, conference presentations, my notes from courses and conferences, teaching material, <a href="/contributions/media">my media appearances</a> etc. You will also find an updated <a href="/cv/cv.pdf">cv</a>, and of course my <a href="/#contact">contact information</a>. In addition, I plan to create and maintain lists of resources I find useful, such as blogs/webpages, talks and papers. For now the page is in English, but parts of it might at some point be translated to Norwegian.</p>

<div id="blogging" class="section level2">
<h2>Blogging</h2>
<p>I also plan to maintain a blog, with more or less regular posts on different topics, update on new pages etc.</p>
